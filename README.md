# sit_rez_attach

The objective here was to create an object, that when sat on, would rez a prop and attach it to the sitter's avatar.
I couldn't find any good examples of this, so I thought I should publish one.

1. Create an object for the prop, name it 'rezee' and put the rezee.lsl script in it.  Take it into your inventory.
2. Create an object for the rezzer, put the rezzer.lsl and rezee object inside it.
3. ???
4. World dominaton!

I'm happy to accept PR's if you find bugs or oversights or horrible design faults!

This isn't intended to be complete, but I'd like to think that most of the bases are covered.

Cheers,

G.
